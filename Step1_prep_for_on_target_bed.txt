Files you should have before CNV analysis 

1.We assume that you have .bam files.  
2.targeted .bed file provided by the manufacturer  
3. Files for hg38 have to be prepared by yourself (hg38.fa) 
Important: don't mix samples sequenced with different enrichment kits - coverage patterns are different 
4. on-target read coverage (has to be supported by on-target .bed file, annotated with GC content - procedure for annotation will be described below) 
5. text files with comma separated sample IDs where each line contains IDs of mother, father, kid (order is important) for trio framework. 
Note: sample names should be the same as in your coverage file (the column names). 

#use absolute path

Generation of .bed files (on-target) 

.bed file annotation 

#ngsbits has to be installed (see github pages-use conda to create and activate the env). GC-annotation is mandatory. Annotation with genes is optional. 
#activate the env 

$ conda activate ngsbits

#check their command 

#/home/users/hamidahghani20/.conda/envs/ngsbits/bin/BedAnnotateGC --help

#GC should be in you 4th col, remove unnecessary cols if any 

#Optionally, your .bed file may be annotated with genes, intersecting with target region
#off-target not recommended for WES
